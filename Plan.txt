Visualizations to make:
- crime heatmap
- streetlight heatmap/points
- suggested streetlight locations*


* This will work by:
1. searching for points with high crime rates
	- Geohash boston 
	- Run through all crimes to count crimes per geohash area
		g*n runtime
	- For every count > threshold, that geohash location (G) is a high interest area
2. counting streetlamps in those geohashes (within a certain threshold)
	- For each G, calculate the streetlights within
		G*n runtime
3. filtering out areas with enough streetlamps already
4. plot the center of each of those areas
